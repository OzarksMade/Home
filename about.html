					<h style="color:orange;font-size:20px;">About the Company</h>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How we got started:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">The OzarksMade company originated under a different name and on a different website. Our main service was a blog hosted on Google's BlogSpot under the name 'Ozarks Tech Thoughts'. We also offered a few random Android Apps created using the Sketchware IDE. You can still download those today here on the <a href="apps.html">OzarksMade Apps</a> page, however they are no longer supported.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How we have progressed:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">Slowly we have grown to become what we are today. As we began to offer more products and services, our website grew and became more robust as we transitioned into the 'OzarksMade' Company.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How we got our name:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">It seems like most things these days are Made in China and if they aren't, they mind as well be. Most companies these days that offer products and services related to tech have headquarters in Southern California. Products and Services made by The OzarksMade Company are only Made in the Ozarks, hence the name 'OzarksMade'.</p>

					<h style="color:orange;font-size:20px;">About our Developer</h>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">Where he's located:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">OzarksMade's Developer, Richard Browning, is located in the Ozarks Mountains in Southwest Missouri, hence why all of the products and services we offer are made only right here, in the Ozarks.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">Who Richard is:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">Richard Browning, OzarksMade Owner and Developer, is simply a person who loves programming and development, and simply wanted to develop something in his free time that everyone involved could benefit from. You can contact Richard by contacting the OzarksMade Company here on the <a href="contact.html">OzarksMade Contact</a> page.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How Richard started developing:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">Richard wasn't always as interested or knowledgeable in Coding and Development as he now is. It was basically by chance that he became as interested as he now is, and that he learned as much as he did in the field of mobile development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js are the programming languages Richard is most knowledgeable in. The Android Apps OzarksMade offers have been primarily created with the Sketchware IDE.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">A message from Richard:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">"If you are reading this, you want to know a little more about me and what I have to offer. I sincerely thank you for your interest. My goal always has been to enjoy the experience of creating services, through programming and development, that users will enjoy utilizing. I genuinely hope that if you have made it this far into my brand, you feel I have succeeded in this goal. If there is anything in my power I can do to enrich your experience with my brand, please don't hesitate to contact me."</p>

					<h style="color:orange;font-size:20px;">Credits</h>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">QuickEdit:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">QuickEdit Text Editor by Rhythm Software was the primary Code Editor app for the development of all OzarksMade Apps and Services where code editing software was required. Link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit">App Details in Google Play Store</a>.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">Termux:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">Termux, the Android terminal emulator and Linux enviroment has been a priceless resource for executing Node.js code so that I could debug it during during development of corresponding OzarksMade Services. Link: <a href="https://termux.dev/">Termux main site</a>.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">Sketchware:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">The original Sketchware App was a great starter resource for the genesis of OzarksMade Apps, but when its resources were exhausted, the new Sketchware Pro was an invaluable asset to putting the final touches on the most valuable OzarksMade Apps. A big thanks to the Sketchware Pro Modder Team. Link: <a href="https://sketchware-pro.ga/">Sketchware Pro: home</a>.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">Samsung:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">All Development for anything related to OzarksMade has been done only on various Samsung Galaxy devices such as the J3 Luna Pro, A20s, and Note20 5G. No laptop or desktop has been involved in the development of OzarksMade whatsoever. Samsung's superior UI has been essential to getting things done right.
