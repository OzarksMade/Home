					<h style="color:orange;font-size:20px;">About OzarksMade</h>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How we got started:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">The OzarksMade company originated under a different name and on a different website. Our main service was a blog hosted on Google's BlogSpot under the name 'Ozarks Tech Thoughts'. We also offered a few random Android Apps created using the Sketchware IDE. You can still download those today, however they are no longer supported.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How we have progressed:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">Slowly we have grown to become what we are today. As we began to offer more products and services, our website grew and became more robust as we transitioned into the "OzarksMade" Company.</p>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How we got pur name:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">It seems like most things these days are Made in China and if they aren't, they mind as well be. Most companies that offer products and services related to tech have headquarters in Southern California. The OzarksMade Company is Made in the Ozarks, hence the name 'OzarksMade'. The Ozarks Mountains in Southwest Missouri are where our developer is.</p>

					<h style="color:orange;font-size:20px;">About the Developer</h>
					<p style="font-size:17px;font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:0px;">How he started developing:</p>
					<p style="margin-top:7.5px;">I haven't always been interested or knowledgeable in Coding and Development. It was basically by chance that I became as interested as I now am, and that I learned as much as I did in this field.</p>
