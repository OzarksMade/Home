	Hello. This is a long sample blog. Here we sample blogs, and sample the samples. Sample blogs are cool because they give you a sample of a blog even though the blog is just a sample.

	Here is the real question though. Is a sample blog actually considered a blog post, or just a sample? Regardless of the answer, sample blogs are still the tastiest way to sample a blog even if the sample might not actually be a blog.

	Conclusion: we enjoyed this sample blog and are very sad it has to come to an end. But all good things have to come to an end? Well, I guess life is evidence of that?ðŸ¤”
