     The Samsung Galaxy Note20 5G is a high-end model smartphone released by Samsung in the year 2020. Despite that, the Galaxy Note 20 is still a flagship worthy device today. While the Galaxy Note 20 lineup was the last of the Galaxy Note Series, the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra were and still are worthy of the title of Galaxy Note.

     After owning the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 5G Factory Unlocked, US Version (Model: SM-N981U1) in Mystic Gray for nearly a year now as my primary and only device, I have no regrets and the device still lives up to everything Samsung claimed it would live up to. While the Note 20 is in some ways 'watered down' compared to its counterpart, the Note 20 Ultra, it still lives up to its promise to look and perform like a top of the line device. The key differences between the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra are that the Note 20 has a plastic back and a 6.7" screen while the Note 20 Ultra has a glass back and a 6.9" screen along with better camera specs.

     Having owned only budget Samsung devices in the past, I wanted stepping up to the Galaxy Note 20 to be something worthy of the dramatic uptick in price as well as something that I wouldn't regret and something that wouldn't get old and outdated over time. My biggest worry when purchasing the Galaxy Note 20 was that since some shortcuts were taken to make it cheaper than its full fledged counterpart, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, it would feel like I was once again, settling for a budget like device to save money. After using the Note 20 exclusively for nearly a year, I can say I was for sure wrong. The Note 20 does not compromise when it comes to design or performance.

     If I had to say what I thought was the most relevant way to describe the plastic back on the Note 20, I would have to say that it repels fingerprints. Unlike the 'Glasstic' back that Samsung supposedly put on some of its phones to imitate glass backs, the Note 20's plastic back is not a fingerprint magnet. While you cannot actually claim that the screen on the Galaxy Note 20 is edge to edge, with its super slim bezels, it is damn near close. And I don't know about you, but if I ever need a screen bigger than 6.7", I'm just going to use Samsung DeX on a 65" TV screen, because the Note 20 is equipped with that.
